# PWA Text Editor

## Description
  
There are various means of optimizing content distribution delivered to the client side. In order to learn a common technique of allowing information to be updated to for the client in an efficient manner, I have set out to create a simple text editor that uses progressive web applications. Now a user can view a web application that was made for the browser offline on their own computer using the tools provided by PWA's and workbox. I learned how to use a service worker, different caching methods, and how a manifest can be used to create a web application that can be used offline.
